Pages wider extension for the browser since I'm not a fan of a "trendy" narrow texts view.  
Find it is annoying to scroll back and forth during reading docs.  

# How does it work
The script simply finds all the elements on the DOM that have max-width prop and set it to 100%.

# Installation
The repository contains two branches.
1. Clone the entire stuff 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/artzhk/pages-wider
```

2. Checkout the browser your need (replace chrome with firefox, if needed)  
So far only chrome and firefox are supported

```bash
git checkout chrome 
```

3. Load extensions to the chrome or firefox.

# Suggestions or improvements?
Don't hesitate to open a PR if have you have yet another idea how to improve pages extension.
